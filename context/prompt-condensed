SPATIAL: X neg=left/pos=right, Y neg=off/pos=def. Count blockers vs defenders at POA. Check QB bootleg has blockers.
KEY CHECKS:
- Unblocked defenders in path?
- Routes into coverage voids? Open windows?
- Numerical advantages at POA?
- Blitz w no backfield protection = less success more leverage
- Blocking mismatches (inferior vs elite) = less success more leverage
- Bear front hurts zone runs, helps gap runs
- Deep zones on play side = lower leverage
- Man coverage: = higher leverage
EXAMPLES:
- Offense +8 to +10: convoy of blockers, defense out of position
- Defense -8 to -10: unblocked rusher, routes into coverage
- Neutral/Good defensive call -4 to 0: proper scheme, even matchups
- Wrong coverage/commit +2 to +5: man-beater vs zone or run-commit vs pass
