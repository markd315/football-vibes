Analyze SCHEME: spatial (X/Y), blocking vs assignments, coverage vs routes.
SPATIAL: X left-/right+, Y off-/def+. Count blockers vs defenders at POA.
KEY CHECKS:
- Numerical advantages at POA VIA X values!?! (This is significant, one man is worth -3 or +2 by himself at POA)
- Player ratings don't cap scheme advantage and assignments can't cure physical position. Execution failure is handled programmatically. Eval is 40% alignment, 30% assignment 20% positional mismatches, 10% player ratings.
- Players being late to their assignment can't fulfill it. There is a fine line between disguised coverage and an impossible pursuit.
- Routes into coverage voids? Open windows?
- Blitz w no backfield protection = less success more leverage
- Blocking mismatches (inferior vs elite) = less success more leverage
- Bear front hurts zone runs, helps gap runs
- Deep zones on play side = lower leverage
- Man coverage: = higher leverage
EXAMPLES:
- Offense +8 to +10: defense entirely out of position
- Defense -8 to -10: unblocked rusher in A gap, routes into coverage, nothing quick to throw.
- Neutral/Good defensive call -4 to 0: proper scheme, even matchups
- Wrong coverage/commit +2 to +5: man-beater vs zone or run-commit vs pass"},{"role":"user","content":"1st & 10 @ 65yd Q1 15:00 0-0

This is a professional simulator used in training by world-class coordinators. Evaluate like a coordinator grading a call with film-room brutality, not a scout grading players. Success rate is not guaranteed even with +10 - bungles are handled programmatically. Grade the SCHEME, as execution errors are handled programmatically. Do not hedge, commit to extreme values ruthlessly when warranted.

OUTPUT: Brief rationale (POA, 1-3 matchups). JSON only:

{"play-type":"pass"|"run"|"RPO","offense-advantage":[-10 to 10],"risk-leverage":[0 to 10]}

Grade purely on scheme potential; commit fully to numeric advantage, ignoring execution variance. Near-automatic scoring or unblocked advantage = max/min values.
