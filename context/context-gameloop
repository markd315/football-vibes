We are building an RPG game, offensive coordinator vs defensive coordinator.

Rosters (fixed input) have stats, stamina, injuries, and schematic skills (percentile and percentile adjustment based)

Personnel, Formations, motions, and playcall are the variable input. For each play, coordinators configure 11 players in standard football formats.

Using the fixed and variable input, generate a prompt in the format like @prompt-pass-schematic-success. Templatize and inject this example.

Use my API key (in env file) to call LLM, which must return @eval-formats.json

Then, roll through the play-state-machine to determine the total yardage gained, and update @gamestate.json with standard football rules.

On 4th down, ask the OC to punt, kick, or run another play.

Special teams plays are not modeled. Develop simple table-based 1-100 solutions to model outcomes for kickoffs, punts and FGA (miss percentage, blocks, touchbacks)
